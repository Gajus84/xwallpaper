.TH XWALLPAPER 1 "xwallpaper 0.2.0" "XWALLPAPER"
.SH NAME
xwallpaper \- wallpaper setting utility for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwallpaper [--screen <screen>] [--no-randr] [--output <output>] [--center <file>] [--maximize <file>] [--stretch <file>] [--tile <file>] [--zoom <file>] [--version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xwallpaper
program allows you to set image files as your X wallpaper. PNG file format
is supported by default and preferred, but optional JPEG support exists as well.
.PP
The wallpaper is also advertised to programs which support semi-transparent
backgrounds.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The various options are as follows:
.IP "\fB--center \fP \fIfile\fP
Centers the input file on the screen. If the dimensions of the input file are
smaller than the screen dimensions, the remaining area is filled black. If the
input file dimensions are too large, parts of the image will be cropped.
.IP "\fB--maximize \fP \fIfile\fP
Maximizes input file to fit screen without cropping. This could mean zooming in
or out, depending on the dimensions of the input file and the screen. This
option guarantees that the whole image is seen. If the ratio does not fit the
screen, the remaining area is filled black. The image itself will be centered
on screen.
.IP "\fB--no-randr\fP
Ignores individual outputs and uses the whole screen instead. This is the area
that spans across all different outputs (monitors).
.IP "\fB--output \fP \fIoutput\fP
Specifies the output on which a subsequently supplied file shall be set as
wallpaper. You can retrieve a list of outputs on your system by executing
\fIxrandr(1)\fP. If no output is specified, all outputs will be modified
individually.
The special keyword \fIall\fP will repeat subsequent actions on all displays.
.IP "\fB--screen \fP \fIscreen\fP
Specifies a screen by its screen number. Normally all screens of an X display
are processed. Please note that a screen is not a single monitor. See
\fI\-\-output\fP for such a use case above. If the screen could not be found,
nothing happens.
.IP "\fB--stretch \fP \fIfile\fP
Stretches input file to fully cover the screen. If the aspect ratio of the
input file does not match the screen, then the ratio of the input file is
adjusted.
.IP "\fB--tile \fP \fIfile\fP
Uses tiling mode. Draws the input file at the upper left corner of the screen
and repeats the image until the remaining area of the screen is covered.
.IP "\fB--version\fP
Prints version and exits.
.IP "\fB--zoom \fP \fIfile\fP
Zooms input file to fit screen with cropping. This could mean zooming in or out,
depending on the dimensions of the input file and the screen. If the ratio
does not fit the screen, parts of the input file will not be shown. The image
itself will be centered on screen. Default behaviour if no option was selected.
.PP
If multiple contradicting options were given, the last supplied option wins.
It is also possible to repeat output arguments without any subsequent files.
In that case, the last mode and file will be re-used.
.SH EXAMPLES
Centers a PNG file as a wallpaper on LVDS-1:
.RS
xwallpaper --output LVDS-1 --center file.png
.RE
.PP
Tiles a PNG file as a wallpaper across all outputs:
.RS
xwallpaper --no-randr --tile file.png
.RE
.PP
Zooms into a JPEG file as a wallpaper on each output individually:
.RS
xwallpaper --zoom file.jpg
.RE
.PP
Tiles a JPEG file as a wallpaper on VGA-1 and zooms into a PNG file on LVDS-1:
.RS
xwallpaper --output VGA-1 --tile file.jpg --output LVDS-1 --zoom file.png
